# Introduction

This documentation describes KiCad SI wrapper, a collection of Python scripts supporting the process of selecting a PCB trace
from a fully-functional KiCad PCB design, so
it can be then simulated with [openEMS](https://www.openems.de/).
`si-wrapper` was designed as an interface between a PCB file designed
in KiCad and the [gerber2ems](https://github.com/antmicro/gerber2ems) tool.
